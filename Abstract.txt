INTERACTIVE LEARNING (Tuto-Learn)

           This project aims to develop an application for an interactive learning platform, which is used for self-directed learning. The project consists of three modules for tutors, 
students, and administrators. The proposed system addresses the challenges associated with keeping users engaged over the long term; implementing features such as interactive quizzes and
regular content updates can be helpful. The main purpose of this web application is to provide a perfect learning platform for users. The key features include a user-friendly and 
interactive interface, generating a dynamic and engaging learning experience. By utilizing a robust MySQL backend and a PHP framework, this project ensures efficient data management, 
scalability, and a seamless user experience. The MySQL database facilitates secure storage and retrieval of user data, enabling real-time progress tracking and integration of interactive
quizzes. With a focus on user authentication and data security, this project stands as an innovative solution, combining technology and pedagogy to create a dynamic and scalable platform
for interactive and effective learning experiences. Users receive certificates that are automatically generated after completing all videos and scoring higher than 40%, providing them
with a tangible recognition for their achievements. Learning becomes more accessible, engaging, and rewarding due to the smooth implementation of video-based instruction, certification,
and assessments.
